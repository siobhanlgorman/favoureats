# Agile
The Agile methodology was used to plan the project. Github was used as the tool to demonstrate this. However Github is not the ideal tool to adequately link Iterations - Epics - User Stories. Although I linked User Stories (Issues) to Epics (Milestones) and placed these in Iterations (Milestones), Epics did not automatically show the % progress to completion once user stories were moved in the kanban board. It also proved difficult with this developer's level of competence and the short time frame allowed, to accurately itemise all tasks in a user story in advance of implementation. As a result some user stories were updated during the course of implementation.

### Project Goal

The goal of the project is to create a recipe website with tried and tested recipes for both family meals and dinner parties. Inspiration for the site came from a book club group who requested a place to store the recipes for the lovely dinners provided at their regular meetings. This idea was expanded to appeal more broadly to general users looking for good recipes and a means to store, edit and delete their own favourite recipes.
