# Agile
The Agile methodology was used to plan the project. Github was used as the tool to demonstrate this. However Github is not the ideal tool to adequately link Iterations - Epics - User Stories. Although I linked User Stories (Issues) to Epics (Milestones) and placed these in Iterations (Milestones), Epics did not automatically show the % progress to completion once user stories were moved in the kanban board. It also proved difficult with this developer's level of competence and the short time frame allowed, to accurately itemise all tasks in a user story in advance of implementation. As a result some user stories were updated during the course of implementation.
